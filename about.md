# Autodesk Configuration with Inventor Automation API
Using the Autodesk Configuration with Inventor Automation API web application one can easily manage and edit Inventor projects using only a web browser and an internet connection. The following operations are available:
- manage custom Inventor projects (list, upload, delete)
- interactively display the model
- change editable parameters and update the model
- list bill of materials
- generate model drawing
- download individual Inventor project assemblies (.IAM), Revit 3D model (.RFA), bill of material (.CSV) and model drawing (.PDF)

The application is available using this link: https://inventor-config-demo.autodesk.io

Non authenticated anonymous users can work with two predefined projects: Wheel and Wrench. 

The ability to upload custom projects is only for invited customers. Once you get the invitation, you need to authenticate using your Autodesk APS account. To sign up for the APS account, follow the instructions at https://aps.autodesk.com/.

Every operation (i.e. model update after change of parameters, drawing creation) is computed in the cloud. For this purpose, Cloud Credits are required. Free Cloud Credits are provided to try APS after signing up. For more information about pricing, please see https://aps.autodesk.com/pricing.
